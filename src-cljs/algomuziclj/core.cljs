<p>Algorithmic music composition CLJS version
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>Generate chords suite according to a bigram table with statistical probabilities. It ease the problem of harmony rules to deal with. It would have been a better way, but well 36 hours of hammock is perhaps a little long and I would have used some days more :D
<p>This will give the bass moves. The other voices will have their notes shoosen randomly according to some exception rules.
<p>Melodic movement of all voices will be created randomly according to counterpoint rules.
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>Well, we go. I think it will be very short.... still don't know how to handle it, it will come as code flows...
<p>And we give up... We'll continue, but probably first in Clojure...")
