Algorithmic music composition CLJS version

Steps
=====

Generate chords suite according to a bigram table with statistical probabilities. It ease the problem of harmony rules to deal with. It would have been a better way, but well 36 hours of hammock is perhaps a little long and I would have used some days more :D

This will give the bass moves. The other voices will have their note shoosen randomly according to some exception rules.

Melodic movement of all voices will be created randomly according co counterpoint rules.

Coding
======

Well, we go. I think it will be very short.... still don't know how to handle it, it will come as code flows...
