It ease the problem of harmony rules to deal with. It would have been a better way, but well 36 hours of hammock is perhaps a little long and I would have used some days more :D\n<p>This will give the bass moves. The other voices will have their notes shoosen randomly according to some exception rules.\n<p>Melodic movement of all voices will be created randomly according to counterpoint rules.\n<h2>Coding</h2>\n<p>Well, we go. I think it will be very short.... still don't know how to handle it, it will come as code flows...\n<p>And we give up... We'll continue, but probably first in Clojure...\n<h3>Good luck for all ClojureCupers, thanks a lot for the ClojureCup staff ;)</h3>");
